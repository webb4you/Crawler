Crawler is a basic PHP Crawler that is very simple to use and is easily adaptable to fit your needs. You can add plugins
that can be used to implement your own logic at key moments during the crawl process.

It is bundled with a basic data Harvester that you can be used to scrape any data from any webpage that can be crawled
using basic CSS 3 selectors. With the bundled Scraper plugin you can be crawling and scraping any website within a couple
minutes of installing the package.

Check the example directory to see how easy it is to implement and use the Crawler.
